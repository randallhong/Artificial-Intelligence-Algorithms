# Artificial-Intelligence-Algorithms
I have stuied these algorithms in Artificial Intelligence course at WPI.
All of these algorithms implmentations as homeworks assigned by Dmitry Berenson(P).
I have finished several algorithms:
1. Convex optimization by using a package called "cvxopt" and Newton's method.
2. CSP(Constraint Satisfaction Problem) and Stimulating Annealing algorithms. Using these two algorithm to solve some sudoku problems
3. ANN(Artificial Neuron Network) and K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms. Using these two algorithms to make prediction and classification.
4. A-star algorithm. Using this algorithm to solve maze problem.
5. Rejection sampling and Likelihood weighting algorithms. Using these two algorihtms to compute the probability of one thing.
